# GFanalysis


This is part of my master's thesis project. Here, I will compare different types of grid-forming converter to a grid-following one. Later one, the grid-forming converters will be applied to distribution grids. These grids will then be aggregated and simulation will be run to see the effects of such converters at a transmission level. The main specific goal is to see how an exisitng grid reduction methodology performs in terms of accuracy when Grid Forming converters are used in distribution networks.  
This scripts are meant to be interacting with DIgSILENT PowerFactory, so they will not run alone.
