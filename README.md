# GFanalysis


This is my master's thesis project. Here, I will compare different types of grid-forming converter to a grid-following one. Later one, the grid-forming converters will be applied to distribution grids. These grids will then be aggregated and simulation will be run to see the effects of such converters at a transmission level.
